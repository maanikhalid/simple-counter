# A simple javascript counter. 
This is my first attempt at learning javascript. 

My first lesson isn't a big one but I'm told its an important one. It's a simple javascript code to get the hang of the language and its only purpose is to count, save, reset and clear history.  

Only way is up from here I guess.
